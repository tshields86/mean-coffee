# MEAN Coffee Shops NYC

## Application for commenting on coffee shops in the NYC area build with the MEAN stack.

### The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of the MEAN stack including building a REST interface with Express.js on top of Node.js and using that interface to perform CRUD operations on a database via an AngularJS frontend.

#### In addition to technologies that make up MEAN, other libraries include:
  - Mongoose.js for adding structure to MongoDB
  - Angular ui-router for client-side routing
  - Twitter Bootstrap for some quick styling
